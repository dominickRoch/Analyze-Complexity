# Analyze-Complexity
This project aims to create a simple code complexity analysis tool in C. The tool analyzes the given code to estimate its time complexity using a basic approach without relying on regular expressions. The analysis includes identifying loops (for and while) and conditional structures (if and else) in the code.
